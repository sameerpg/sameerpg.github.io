    <h1>Annotations</h1>
    
   <h3>Annotaions are weekly homework on the book Give Me Liberty.</h3>
   
    <p>Annotations are a helpful tool to develop analysis. Each chapter covers a long period of time and I develop many ideas on the different topic covered. Annotations are due at least a week apart, so I have a long time to think about the evidence and draw conclusions. They are usually a broader version of what we do in class during the week. This allows for me to develop analysis ahead of class. This artifact show critical thinking because every time I analyze the evidence every page. </p>
