 <h1>strength </h1>
   <p> I believe my strength is that I can lead and be a team player in group projects. I'm adept at accepting, generating, and merging ideas, no matter with whom I work. During the "Door Project" in film, my group wrote a script. Then we were given another team's script and got our's taken away. We had to interpret the film based only on the script. Our time was reduced by difficulties such as rain and another group at the same location, but the biggest problem we had was interpreting the script. The class did not know we would be swapping scripts, so groups didn't put enough detail into it. Given the short timeline and as the actor, I took the lead in interpreting the script and how the scene would go. My interpretation of the script helped the cinematographer to determine the shot angle and helped the director bring the story to life.</p>
