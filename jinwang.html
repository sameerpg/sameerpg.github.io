 <h1>strength </h1>
   <p>My strength has remained constant, I have no problems working in group projects. Whoever I work with I'm good at accepting, producing and merging ideas. You need to form an idea that is appealing to everybody. During the door project in film, my group wrote a script. Then we were given another team's script which we had to interpret the groups film based on only the script. There was another group at the same location, it rained, and we had to assume where some objects were supposed to be. But overall my group overcame these problems to produce our film </p>
