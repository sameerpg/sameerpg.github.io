 <h1>strength </h1>
   <p>My strength has remained constant, I have no problems working in group problems. Whoever I work with I have no problems accepting, producing and merging ideas. You need to form an idea that is appealing to everybody. During the door project in film, my group made a script and had a plan. Then we were given another script which we had to interpret the groups film. We had many problems. There was another at the same location, it rained, and we had to assume where some objects were supposed to be. </p>
