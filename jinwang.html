 <h1>strength </h1>
   <p>My strength has remained constant: I work well in group projects. I'm adept at accepting, producing and merging ideas, no matter with whom I work. During the door project in film, my group wrote a script. Then we were given another team's script and got our own taken away. We had to interpret the film based only on the script. We had difficulties at our location such as rain and another group at the same location. The biggest problem we had was interpreting the script. The class did not know we would be swapping scripts, so groups didn't put superb detail into it. As the actor, it was most important for me to understand the script and how the scene would go. I could also help the cinematographer to decide where the shot was being filmed from.</p>
