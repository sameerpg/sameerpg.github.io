 <h1>strength </h1>
   <p>My strength has remained constant: I work well in group projects. I'm adept at accepting, producing and merging ideas, no matter whom I work with. You need to form an idea that is appealing to everybody. During the door project in film, my group wrote a script. Then we were given another team's script which we had to interpret the groups film based on only the script. There was another group at the same location, it rained, and we had to assume where some objects were supposed to be. But overall my group overcame these problems to produce our film </p>
