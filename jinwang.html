 <h1>strength </h1>
   <p> I believe my strength is that I can lead and be a team player in group projects. I'm adept at accepting, generating, and merging ideas, no matter with whom I work. During the door project in film, my group wrote a script. Then we were given another team's script and got our own taken away. We had to interpret the film based only on the script. Our time was reduced by difficulties such as rain and another group at the same location. The biggest problem we had was interpreting the script. The class did not know we would be swapping scripts, so groups didn't put superb detail into it. As the actor, it was important for me to understand the script and how the scene would go. I could also help the cinematographer to decide where the shot was being filmed from.</p>
