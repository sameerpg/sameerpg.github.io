    <h3> Goal </h3>
    
    <p> My goal is to write with more analysis. Writing with analysis is most necessary going into high school. I will measure my goal by my grades and notes from my teachers. I look to work analysis into everything I write this year, so I get lots of practice for my goal. </p>
