    <h3> Goal </h3>
    
    <p> My goal is to write with more analysis. Analysis is crucial to essays, and without a voice an essay is just a summary. Analysis is a key thing learned in eighth grade at Rhoades and will help a lot going into high school. I look to work analysis into everything I write this year, so I get lots of practice for my goal. </p>
