<h3>Stretch and Goal</h3>
    <p> My stretch is writing with analysis.  Analysis is putting my own thoughts in writing so that it is not just a summary. Analysis needs to be backed up by evidence, to show the reader that your claims make sense. In lower grades analysis was not necessary, so it is more of a challenge than other aspects of writing.  </p>
