    <h3>Test, Homework, and Journal</h3>
    <body> <p> My journal reflects my knowledge in math and ability to take helpful notes. It has everything we have covered or reviewed this year. It shows my precision and accuracy because my notes are always helpful when doing homework or studying for a test. My homework and tests reflect weaknesses such as not reading the instructions or not focusing enough.</p></body>
