<h1>Lit Artifact: Final Scarlet Letter Essay</h1>
 
   <p>The Scarlet Letter Essay was an essay written on one of the seven prompts. The prompt I chose was the significance of nature in the scarlet letter. </p>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>I chose to include my literature artifact because it shows that I need more analysis and that it is my main problem. Although I did not get a good grade, I still feel it was one of the best essays I've ever written. I went over the essay and weeded out all of other mistakes. I just needed a bit more analysis. I just need to provide evidence, then write what I think.
